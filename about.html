<h1>About Me</h1>

<section class="about-me">
<p>
My name is Jacob Heileson, and I’m currently studying Software Development at the College of Western
Idaho, where I plan to graduate in 2027. I’m working toward becoming a developer who specializes in clean,
logical, and algorithmic-based software.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my studies, I’ve trained in several programming languages, including Java, HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, and I enjoy applying these skills to build practical and efficient applications. I’m especially
interested in solving complex problems and creating solutions that are both functional and well-structured.
</p>

<p>
I’m continually working to expand my skills, deepen my understanding of software design, and prepare for a
career where I can contribute to meaningful projects and keep growing as a developer.
